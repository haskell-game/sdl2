The following example shows how setting a watch for the WindowSizeChangedEvent
allows us to handle the events as they are generated. Handling them in the
event loop, on the other hand, only allows us to see a final, coalesced, event.

To demonstrate this, run the program, resize the window with your mouse,
and check your console output.
